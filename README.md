------------------
In this project, we will design a web application where
teachers can log into their accounts and create quizzes by adding questions,
multiple-choice options, and correct answers.
Once the quiz is published, 
students can enter the website, take the quiz, and submit their answers.
At the end of the quiz, their final score will be calculated and displayed automatically.
In addition, teachers will have access to a dashboard where they can see a table containing 
the names of the students who participated and their corresponding scores.
